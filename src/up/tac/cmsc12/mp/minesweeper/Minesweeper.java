     * TODO: Add logic here.
     * This should be the main Minesweeper Model (in the MVC Framework)
     * that handles the boardstate, what to do when certain actions are
     * done, how the board is generated, and also constructors for
     * different board sizes. That could also be done using some
     * integer constants that dictate what board to use maybe you can
     * use those for ez switch-case stuff within the constructor? idk
     * 
     * You can add the other stuff like the Board class that could
     * basically just hold the Minesweeper board data into a 
     * different file in this folder. If you have the VSCode
     * extensions it should automatically add the package line at
     * the very top for you.
